== Overview

This is a template-project for

* generating AsciiDoc-Files to html-files and
* deploying the html-files to gh-pages,
* where the gh-pages are located in an branch of the repo.

AsciiDoctor - the software for converting the .adoc-files to .html-files - is executed in a Docker container.
So you have nothing to install on your local machine, except Docker

Two scripts are available:

* build-html-docker.sh -> builds the .html-pages in the folder gh-pages
* publish-gh-pages.sh -> buils and deploys the gh-pages

== gh-pages

This are the gh-pages of the template-project.

== Steps to your own doc-repo

=== Create your own github-repo

Leave it empty for now.

=== Clone the Template Repo

----
git clone https://github.com/htl-leonding-college/asciidoctor-docker-template.git
----

=== Change the Remote Origin

For your own documentation change the remote origin to
your own empty git-repo and commit your own docs.

* Rename folder of project (from `asciidoctor-docker-template` to <your-repo-name>)
* Rename Project
* Project Structure - Project - Rename Project
* change git remote

.Your current remote origin
----
git remote -v
----

.Change the remote origin
----
git remote set-url origin <new repo link>
----

ie

----
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/htl-leonding/asciidoctor-docker-testdrive.git
----

.Your new remote origin
----
git remote -v
----


In case you change your remote repository to https URL, you will be prompted for your username and password next time you use git fetch, git pull or git push.

=== Commit some Files into the New Repo

Commit the shell-scripts, .ignore-File, ... into the repo.
It is not possible to create gh-pages, without content in the repo.

=== Activate the gh-pages for your repo.

| `build-pdf-docker.sh`
| creates the pdf-output

| `build-reveal-docker.sh`
| creates the reveal-output for generating slides

| `download-reveal.sh`
| downloads the reveal-library from the github-repo and unzips the files.
This script is used by `build-reveal-docker.sh`.

| `build-all.sh`
| create the html-, pdf-, and revealjs-output

| `clean-all.sh`
